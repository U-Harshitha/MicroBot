# Minibot - NLP Chat Bot and Restaurant Website

## Overview

Minibot is a simple learning project that combines a natural language processing (NLP) chat bot with a front-end website for a restaurant. The chat bot interacts with users, providing information related to the restaurant's menu. The project is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to explore the basics of NLP in Python and integrate a chat bot into a website.

## Features

- **NLP Chat Bot:** Minibot uses natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries about the restaurant's menu.

- **Front-end Website:** The project includes a basic front-end website for the restaurant, providing sections for home, menu, location, and contact information.

- **Interactive Chat:** Users can engage with Minibot directly on the website, asking questions about the menu and receiving responses from the chat bot.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **HTML and CSS:** The front-end of the website is implemented using HTML and styled with basic CSS.

- **Chat Bot Logic (Python):** The chat bot's natural language processing logic is implemented in Python.
